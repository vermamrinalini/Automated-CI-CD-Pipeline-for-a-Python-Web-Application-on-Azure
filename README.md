# Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-a-Python-Web-Application-on-Azure
The goal of this project is to create an automated CI/CD pipeline for a Python-based web application, deploying it to Azure App Service. The pipeline will be managed through Azure DevOps, where you will automate processes like code testing, building, containerization, and deployment.
Key Features:
Python Web Application:

Build a small Python web application using a framework like Flask or Django. The app could provide simple RESTful APIs or serve dynamic web pages.
Include unit tests using a framework like pytest to ensure the app is functioning correctly.
Dockerization:

Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Python application, ensuring that it can run consistently in different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Use docker-compose for local development and testing before integrating with Azure.
Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines to:
Build the Docker container image.
Run tests on every code push to ensure the codebase is stable.
Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Docker Hub.
Deploy the Docker container to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates or Terraform to automate the provisioning of the necessary Azure resources such as App Services, Azure Container Registry, and networking resources.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Implement basic monitoring using Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights to track the application's performance and health after deployment.
Set up alerts for application downtime or performance degradation.
Security:

Integrate Azure Key Vault to securely manage application secrets like database credentials and API keys.
Implement security scanning for Docker images using tools like Trivy or Clair.
