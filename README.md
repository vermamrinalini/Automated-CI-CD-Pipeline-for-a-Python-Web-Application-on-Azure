🎯 Project Goal: Create an automated CI/CD pipeline for a Python-based web application, deploying it to Azure App Service. The pipeline will be managed through Azure DevOps, automating processes like code testing, building, containerization, and deployment.

🔑 Key Features:

🐍 Python Web Application: Build a small Python web application using a framework like Flask or Django, including unit tests with pytest.

🐳 Dockerization: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring consistent performance across different environments. Use docker-compose for local development and testing.

🔄 Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline: Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines to build the Docker container image, run tests, push the image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Docker Hub, and deploy to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates or Terraform to automate the provisioning of necessary Azure resources.

📊 Monitoring and Alerts: Implement basic monitoring using Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights, and set up alerts for application downtime or performance degradation.

🔒 Security: Integrate Azure Key Vault to manage application secrets securely and implement security scanning for Docker images using tools like Trivy or Clair.

🛠️ Technologies and Tools: Python, Docker, Azure DevOps, Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Registry (ACR), Terraform or ARM Templates, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor, Application Insights, pytest, and Trivy.
